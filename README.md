# AI_Resume_Building_Web_Application
Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to input their personal details, skills, experience, education, and other relevant information to generate a modern, stylish resume in HTML and CSS format. The app leverages Google Generative AI (Gemini) via Langchain to dynamically generate personalized resume templates. Users fill out a form with their details, and the AI constructs a professional resume with vibrant yet professional design aesthetics.
